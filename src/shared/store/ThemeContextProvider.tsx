/**
 * React Context API is used to handle the application's theme.
 *
 * On first render, theme is loaded from session storage (if any, to retrieve a previously stored value in case of page refresh, or fallbacks to user's preference (set through an operating system setting or a user agent setting) via the media query `window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")`.
 *
 * Then, and Effect is used to handle the selected theme for initial and subsequent renders to:
 *  1. apply the corresponding class to the `body` element
 *  2. set the state for the entire application (to be shared via context to any component)
 *  3. save it to session storage
 *
 * Theme switching with these approach relies on appending / removing a class directly from the `body` HTML (top hierarchy) element, and the use of CSS variables (App.css file) instantiated from Tailwind config. file to be used as custom Tailwind classnames.
 *
 * ðŸš€ This approach for handling theme provides several benefits:
 *  - it does not trigger the whole app to re-renders
 *  - it can be used to handle custom themes besides "light" and "dark"
 *
